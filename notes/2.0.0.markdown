* Dependecies:
    - migrated from avsl to [scala-logging](https://github.com/typesafehub/scala-logging)
    - migrated from lift-json to [upickle](http://lihaoyi.github.io/upickle-pprint/upickle/)
    - removed unnecessary dependencies

* Great refactoring:
    - upgraded to scala-2.11
    - upgraded to statika-2 (not released yet)
    - changed completely bundles structure (less bundles, less layers)
    - removed CLI
    - removed web-console
    - removed control queue; added its commands to the nisperito ops
    - Moved resources creation to the nisperito deploy; removed resources bundle

* Other changes:
    - simplified config, moved there _all_ configurable things
    - moved instructions executor to the worker bundle
    - _some_ changes to the way visibility timeout is extended (has to be reviewed)
    - _common_ typeset inputs/outputs for instructions and tasks
    - renamed tasks to pipas to avoid names conflict (:trollface::sunflower:)
